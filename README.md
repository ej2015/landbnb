This app uses GraphQL for query and mutation in a Rails app.

This is based on this [tutorial](https://blog.codeship.com/how-to-implement-a-graphql-api-in-rails/) and its [repo](https://github.com/leighhalliday/landbnb). It has been updated to use:

  1. Rails5.2
  2. graphql-ruby ~>1.8 (class-based definitions)
